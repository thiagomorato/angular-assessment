#Anglar assessment

This is the front end of a simple invoice system. It was an accessment for a job and it was developed in a few hours so it is just a small sample of my work. Also I can't review publicly what were the assessment specifications so if you find some strange/unusual/funny log or functionality it may be due that. Like not having submit buttons, when you finish adding or editing just go back, the changes are automaticaly saved.
