#Anglar assessment

This is the front end of a simple invoice system. It was an accessment for a job and it was developed in a few hours so it is just a small sample of my work. Also I can't review publicly what were the assessment specifications so if you find some strange/unusual/funny log or functionality it may be due that. Like not having submit buttons, when you finish adding or editing just go back, the changes are automaticaly saved.

To install dependencies: `$ bower install`

Unfortunatelly I can't put the node server here so there is now way to explore it using the browser, I decided to keep it here for code analysis. Also the CSS or UI was not in the scope of this accessment.
